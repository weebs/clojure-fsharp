# h'what is this?
A work in progress interpreter for a subset of the Clojure langugage

# Why?
I've been wanting to learn more about interpreters, and rather than create my own language, I decided it'd be more useful to interpret an existing language and learn more lisp along the way :)

# Goals
- Implement enough of Clojure to be useful
- Have some fun
- ??
- Port parser to be compatible with Fable's JS target
